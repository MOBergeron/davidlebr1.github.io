Hi ! My name is David and I'm a developper in the region of Montreal. I'm a student at l'[École de technologie supérieure](http://www.etsmtl.ca) in the program of information technology engineering.

I'm more focused in computer software, web and security but I like to learn new things.
Otherwise, I'm a passionnate of snowboarding and I like to travel!
